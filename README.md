# Hi there👋
I'm Marco Auer from Winterthur, Switzerland. Currently I'm an IMS (Informatikmittelschule) student studying at the KBW (Kantonsschule Büelrain).
My coding knwoledge goes from react to java with a little bit of bash and regularly uses of css and html. I find it very hard to decide in wich field I'm really
intrested or not because of my lack of experience, I usually hear or learn about something and find it fascinating no matter what it is.

## skills
* ⚛️ react
* 💻 CSS / HTML / JS
